Description of the final dataset
---

The final dataset created by running the R script will contain 180 groups of observations spread over 68 columns (2 grouping variables and 66 averages). The 2 grouping variables are subject and activity. Subject is a identified by a number. There are 30 subjects, so the range of values for subject are 1 to 30. The activity is a categorical variable. There are 6 possible values:  WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING. The rest of the variables are derived from the variables of the original dataset. Names for these variables are kept as in the original dataset (even though their meaning changes). Refer to the file features_info.txt in the original dataset for more informations on the variables. They are accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial measurements from the smartphones. In the final dataset only means and standard deviation variables are kept and then averaged over 180 groups (30 subjects times 6 activities).
